## 1. Purpose of this document

This document describes the Change Request process during the Interim Phase, while the Technical Steering Committee and/or other Intersect bodies are not fully operational. This document also includes a process with a fully operational Intersect before the Chang Hard-Fork. After the hard-fork, any parameter changes will follow the voting process described in CIP-1694.



## 2. Intersect Structure

### **2.1 Roles and Responsibilities**

**Governing Board**\
Executive director: Silona Bonewald

**Committee Chairs**\
Technical Steering Committee: Duncan Soutar\

**Committee Secretaries**\

### **2.2 Remit**

Intersect is a member-based organization that empowers the Cardano community to take ownership of the platform's direction. Through committees and other collaborative mechanisms, Intersect ensures that Cardano's development and governance are driven by the collective insights and expertise of its community members.



## 3. Description of the process - Interim Phase

The Parameter Committee is in Interim Phasee until the TSC is fully operational. Assuming that no governance actions can be submitted and ratified on-chain, the Parameter Committee will act independently of Intersect.

## 4. Description of the process - Fully operational

After the Interim Phase, the Parameter Committee can only make recommendations, not decisions. TSC becomes the ultimate authority to decide upon Mainnet Change Requests. However, it has the ability to scalate to the Intersect Governor's Board if the TSC feels it needs advice. The Intersect Governor's Board does not have the ability to overrule the TSC. It can request the Parameter Committee review any recommendation.

Notes:&#x20;

_Whilst the Parameter Committee remains in an interim state it will act independently of Intersect. Intersect will perform all the administration but will not enact the recommendations until the TSC has the ability to make decisions._

_After the Interim Phase, the Parameter Committee can only make recommendations, not decisions. TSC becomes the ultimate authority to decide upon Mainnet Change Requests. However, it has the ability to scalate to the Intersect Governor's Board if the TSC feels it needs advice. The Intersect Governor's Board does not have the ability to overrule the TSC. It can request the Parameter Committee review any recommendation._

_After the hard-fork, protocol changes will follow the voting process as described in CIP-1694._
