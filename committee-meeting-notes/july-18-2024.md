* Open Discord Channel
* Benchmarking for PCP003
* Updates to Guardrails

Updates

* **Electing Community Members**

It was agreed that domain experts should be elected by Intersect\
members on a three year rolling basis.  Nominees would need to have suitable technical experience. The expectation would be to add one domain expert before Intersect’s AMM in October and then hold elections on an annual basis or in the event that a domain expert stood down.  Existing experts would be able to stand for future terms, without a limit on the number of terms they could serve

* **Use of Cardano Forum**

It was agreed to continue the use of the Cardano Forum as a vehicle\
for general community engagement, and an effective way to publish minutes, receive PCPs etc.

* **Open Discord Channel**\
  \
  It was agreed to set up and monitor an open Parameter Committee Discord channel, with correspondents either directed to the existing Cardano Forum  or responses provided via the channel, as appropriate,
* **Benchmarking for PCP003**\
  \
  Michael Karg (IO Engineering’s Performance and Tracing team) presented preliminary performance results to evaluate the impact of increasing Plutus script execution step limits. While highlighting some concerns, these results suggest that there might be some scope to increase the current limits.  Further investigation is needed into the effects of increasing Plutus script memory unit limits.  These results will be presented at a future meeting.
* **Updates to Guardrails**

Two guardrail changes were proposed:

1,  VT-CC-01

`VT-CC-01 (y): New Constitutional Committee action thresholds must be in the range 65%-90%`

Change to:

`VT-CC-01 (y): New Constitutional Committee action thresholds must be in the range 51%-90%`

2\. PCM-03

`PCM-03: Cost model values must not be negative`

Change to:

`PCM-03: Cost model values should not be negative`

Both changes were agreed.  The change to PCM-03 was agreed unanimously.  The change to VT-CC-01 was agreed by a clear majority.
