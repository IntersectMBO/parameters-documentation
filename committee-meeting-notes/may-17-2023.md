   * Updates on the SPO poll: Live May 17th

   * Kick off of the PCP process with the first proposal.

**Updates:**

* The committee welcomed the new joiners: Martin Lang, Andrew Westberg, Giovanni Gargiulo and Addie Girouard. The structure and the functions of the committee were explained.
* All of the committee members are now in the discord channel, this is the main channel however each Advisory group will set up their own communication channel as well as their own internal working process
* Markus Guffler from CF shared the SPO poll updates: May 17th, the poll is live, at 6pm there were 31 votes. The poll ends in the Epoch 416 (June 3rd), for live stats of the poll you can go to: [Cardanoscan 1](https://cardanoscan.io/spo-polls/96861fe7da8d45ba5db95071ed3889ed1412929f33610636c072a4b5ab550211) or [ADASTAT 1](https://adastat.net/polls/96861fe7da8d45ba5db95071ed3889ed1412929f33610636c072a4b5ab550211). It is good to keep in mind that the final result is decided by the community and that the cardano foundation is only providing the means to gather the communityâ€™s opinions.
* Meeting frequency of the parameter committee changed from every 2 weeks to every 3 weeks, if there is any urgent matter an Ad-hoc meeting can be requested. The changes on the meeting frequency will allow each advisory group to have the proper time to analyze and provide technical, economical or network recommendations.
* Every advisory head gave an update from their groups, they are organizing their activities, some of them will be reaching out to other community members to join their groups. It is the heads responsibility to choose the member based on their experience and knowledge of the Cardano Network
* Following the parameter committee process, the standardization of new requests is done via the PCP. Alex Moser from CF, walked the committee through the template, which was accepted. Each request will have a numeration starting at request number 001. The parameter committee recommendation process does not replace the CIP process and the committee is only to provide recommendations not to make decisions on parameter changes. PCPs from the community will be introduced at a later stage.
* PCP 001 - Raising k (and lowering minFee) was presented and approved by the committee for further action

**Action items:**

* Cristina Echeverry to make sure everyone joined the discord channel
